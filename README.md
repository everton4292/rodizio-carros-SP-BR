## App for checking if your car is in the car rotation system in São Paulo - Brazil. Original ideia by @guoliv3ira web project in [this](https://github.com/guoliv3ira/rodizio-sp) repository
 
 Rodízio veicular, or vehicle restriction, is a restriction on traffic in São Paulo, Brazil, during peak travel times.
 It is based on the last digit of the vehicle's number plate. São Paulo is the largest metropolis in the world with a permanent 
 alternate-day travel restriction. The scheme was first implemented in 1995 as a trial on a voluntary basis, and then as a mandatory restriction implemented in August 1996 
 to mitigate air pollution, and thereafter made permanent in June 1997 to relieve traffic congestion. The driving restriction applies to passenger cars and commercial vehicles, and it is based on the last digit
 of the licence plate. Two numbers are restricted to travel every day between 7 a.m. to 10 a.m. and 5 p.m. to 8 p.m. from Monday through Friday. (Wikipedia, 2020)
*   Monday: 1 and 2 last digits
*   Tuesday: 3 and 4 last digits
*   Wednesday: 5 and 6 last digits
*   Thursday: 7 and 8 last digits
*   Friday: 9 and 0 last digits
*   Saturday and Sunday: The system doesn't apply in the weekends
